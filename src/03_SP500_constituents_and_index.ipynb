    "# HW Guide Part B: Reconstructing the S&P 500 Index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **S&P 500 Index** is one of the most well-known benchmarks for the U.S. equity market. It represents the performance of 500 large-cap companies across various industries, serving as a proxy for the overall stock market. Constructing an index of this nature involves aggregation of market data, weighting by market capitalization, and accounting for changes in index membership over time. This lecture introduces the mechanics of the S&P 500 index, provides an overview of its construction, and guides you through a case study on approximating its level and returns using data from CRSP and WRDS. Some of the information needed to perfectly replicate the S\\&P 500 index is proprietary and not available through WRDS. So, the approximation in the next section will be imperfect. However, it will be close enough. For now, we will use this note to get a better understanding of how the S\\&P 500 is constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Reconstruct the S&P 500 Index?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconstructing the S&P 500 index from its underlying constituents is a valuable exercise for students of quantitative finance. This process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provides Practical Data Experience**: You'll gain hands-on experience with downloading and processing real financial data from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) and CRSP.\n",
    "2. **Develops Insight into Index Construction**: By breaking down the methodology, you will better understand the structure and mechanics of market-capitalization-weighted indices.\n",
    "3. **Builds Programming Skills**: The reconstruction process requires advanced data handling, including merging datasets, calculating weights, and implementing rebalancing rules.\n",
    "4. **Reveals Approximation Techniques**: As the S&P 500’s official calculation includes proprietary adjustments, this exercise demonstrates how to approximate real-world phenomena using accessible data and mathematical techniques.\n",
    "5. **Enhances Quantitative Finance Skills**: The reconstruction builds your ability to analyze returns, index performance, and the impact of portfolio rebalancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture and exercise, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Explain the construction methodology of the S&P 500 index.\n",
    "- Use historical data on index constituents, prices, and shares outstanding to approximate the index.\n",
    "- Implement two methods for approximating the index:\n",
    "  - **Method A**: a simple sum of the market caps of the index's constituents\n",
    "  - **Method B**: an approximation that assumes that a trader forms a porfolio holding the index's constituents and rebalances the portfolio quarterly.\n",
    "- Compare your reconstructed index to the actual S&P 500 index by analyzing the correlation of levels and returns.\n",

    "## Official S\\&P 500 Index Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The S&P 500 index contains approximately 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies by market capitalization, selected by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee based on criteria such as liquidity, profitability, and market size. The index is a **market-capitalization-weighted index**, meaning that each stock in the index is weighted by its market cap. The index is rebalanced quarterly to reflect changes in membership and market values, ensuring it accurately represents the large-cap equity market. Key features of the index include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of the methodology used to calculate the S\\&P 500 index is available [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-index-math.pdf). However, the following steps provide a simplified overview of the calculation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Determine the Market Capitalization of Each Constituent Company\n",
    "\n",
    "The market capitalization of a company represents its total equity value in the stock market. It is determined by multiplying the current market price per share by the total number of outstanding shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\text{MarketCap}_{i, t} = P_{i,t} \\times \\text{Shrout}_{i,t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{i,t}$ is the stock price and $\\text{Shrout}_{i,t}$ is the number of shares outstanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Adjust the Market Capitalization for Free Float\n",
    "\n",
    "The S\\&P 500 utilizes a \"free-float market capitalization-weighted methodology\". This method focuses solely on the shares readily available for trading by the public, excluding those held by company insiders or governments. Therefore, the next crucial step involves adjusting the market capitalization to account for the \"free float\" of each company's shares. Free float refers to the portion of outstanding shares that are readily available for trading in the open market. This adjustment ensures that the index accurately reflects the true market value of the companies based on the shares that investors can actively buy and sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the free-float market capitalization, an Investable Weight Factor (IWF) is employed. The IWF represents the percentage of a company's total outstanding shares that are included in the index calculation. It is used to adjust for various factors, including foreign ownership restrictions, that might affect a stock's actual weight in the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Free-float MarketCap}_{i, t} = \\text{MarketCap}_{i, t} \\times \\text{IWF}_{i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\text{IWF}_{i}$ represents the proportion of a company’s shares that are freely available for trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IWF is typically expressed as a percentage and is obtained from financial data providers. For example, if 80% of a company’s shares are available for public trading, its IWF would be 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculate the Total Market Capitalization of the Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the free-float market capitalization is calculated for each company, these values are summed to arrive at the total market capitalization of the S\\&P 500. This aggregate value serves as the numerator in the index calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total market cap of the index is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MarketCapSP500}_{t} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{S\\&P, t}} \\text{MarketCap}_{i, t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{I}_{S\\&P, t}$ represents the set of constituents at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Calculate the Divisor\n",
    "\n",
    "The divisor is a critical element in the S\\&P 500 calculation. It is a proprietary value determined by S\\&P Dow Jones Indices and is used to scale the index down to a more manageable and reportable level. The divisor is subject to adjustments over time to account for various corporate actions that could influence the index's value. These actions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stock Splits:** When a company splits its stock, the number of outstanding shares increases, while the price per share decreases proportionally. The divisor is adjusted to prevent this corporate action from artificially impacting the index level.  \n",
    "* **Dividends:** While regular cash dividends do not directly affect the index level, special dividends, which are larger, one-time distributions, can influence the divisor.  \n",
    "* **Spinoffs:** When a company spins off a subsidiary into a separate publicly traded entity, the divisor is adjusted to reflect the change in the index's composition.  \n",
    "* **Index Reconstitution:** The S\\&P 500 periodically adds or removes companies to ensure it continues to represent the leading U.S. equities. These changes also necessitate adjustments to the divisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The divisor plays a crucial role in maintaining the index's continuity over time. The divisor adjustment process ensures that these actions do not introduce artificial jumps or drops in the index level.\n",
    "By adjusting for corporate actions and changes in the index's constituents, the divisor ensures that the S\\&P 500 remains a consistent and reliable benchmark for tracking the performance of the U.S. equity market. The formula for the divisor adjustment depends on the specific corporate action and is detailed in S&P Dow Jones Indices’ methodology documents (see [S&P Dow Jones Indices' Index Mathematics Methodology](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-index-math.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Corporate Action   | Impact on Divisor                                       | Example                                                        |\n",
    "|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Stock Split**    | Adjusted to maintain index continuity                   | A 2-for-1 stock split doubles shares but halves the price.     |\n",
    "| **Special Dividend** | Adjusted to account for the distribution               | A one-time dividend reduces market capitalization.            |\n",
    "| **Spinoff**        | Adjusted to reflect the spun-off entity's market cap    | A parent company spins off a subsidiary as a new company.      |\n",
    "| **Index Reconstitution** | Adjusted for additions/removals in the index       | A new company is added, requiring a reweighting of constituents. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Calculate the Index Level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the S&P 500 index level is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Index Level}_{t} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Divisor}_{t}} \\times \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{S\\&P, t}} P_{i,t} \\times \\text{Free-float Shrout}_{i,t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{i,t}$ is the stock price of company $i$ at time $t$, $\\text{Free-float Shrout}_{i,t}$ is the number of freely traded shares of company $i$ at time $t$, and $\\text{Divisor}$ is the proprietary scaling factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula aggregates the weighted market capitalizations of all constituents, scaled by the divisor to produce the reported index level.\n",

Let's assume that the total amount of money in the portfolio at the beginning of the period is 1 (e.g. \\$1 million). Then, assume that at each rebalancing date (in this case, quarterly), the trader buys and sells stocks such that the portfolio weights are equal to the weights of the index's constituents with respect to the ratio of the market cap of each stock to the total market cap of the index.\n",
